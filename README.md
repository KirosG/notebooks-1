# notebooks

With the recent announcement that [Github would directly render Jupyter notebooks](http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/05/07/rendering-notebooks-on-github/), 
it seems interesting to try an experiment.

Census Reporter invites you to make pull requests for notebooks demonstrating methods for analyzing Census data. 
What that looks like remains to be seen! Join in if you want to help figure it out.
