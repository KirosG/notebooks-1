    "I wondered if there were any interesting recent cases of that kind of shift, and decided to see how easy that is with [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org). This is a mostly through-composed notebook, with a little cleanup. Maybe it's useful to other folks, or at least to me when I'm trying to remember how I did something...\n",
